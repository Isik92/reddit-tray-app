              <p>Hi! Great to hear from you. First let me say it's so cool you're planning to organize presentations! We love
                the community that's growing around the project, and things like that are a big part :) We don't offer any
                discounts to anyone. All of our offers are at the same price. If you'd like I can set you up to proceed as
                a qualified investor, but honestly, I think that would be even more hassle than participating in the ICO.
                Unless you'd like to invest more than the 10% limit on the first day (€250,000 or 356.50 ETH at today's price)
                I think your best bet would be to invest in the ICO. What do you think?</p>
