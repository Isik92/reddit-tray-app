# reddit-tray-app
Reddit tray app is a little helper tool which displays all kinds of reddit notifications (replys, messages, mod-messages)

It is implemented as a tray application in Electron and (theoretically) cross-platform. It is at this stage only tested on MacOS though and probably needs some extra configuration to start on other operating Systems.
